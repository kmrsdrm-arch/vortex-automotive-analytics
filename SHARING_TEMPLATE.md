Built a full-stack platform that:
• Visualizes KPIs through an intuitive dashboard
• Translates natural language questions into SQL queries using GPT-4
• Generates AI-powered insights and recommendations
• Provides executive reports on-demand

Technical Implementation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• FastAPI backend with 15+ RESTful endpoints
• PostgreSQL database with optimized schemas
• Streamlit dashboard with real-time data visualization
• OpenAI integration for NLP capabilities
• Deployed on Render.com with production-grade setup

What I Learned:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Building production-ready FastAPI applications
• Integrating LLMs for practical business applications
• Deploying full-stack apps with proper DevOps practices
• Creating intuitive data visualizations

## 🎬 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

```
"I built VORTEX, an AI-powered automotive analytics platform. It takes 
complex sales and inventory data and makes it instantly accessible through 
a beautiful dashboard. The coolest feature? Users can ask questions in 
plain English—like 'What are my top-selling SUVs this month?'—and the app 
uses GPT-4 to translate that into SQL and return the results. I built the 
full stack: FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend, PostgreSQL database, and 
deployed it all to production on Render.com. It showcases my ability to 
take a project from concept to deployment while integrating cutting-edge 
AI capabilities."

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Sharing:

1. ✅ Test all features thoroughly
2. ✅ Replace placeholder GitHub URLs
3. ✅ Ensure OpenAI API has sufficient credits
4. ✅ Check that services are awake (visit links first)
5. ✅ Prepare to explain technical decisions

### During Interview:

Be ready to discuss:
- Why you chose each technology
- Challenges you faced and how you solved them
- How you would scale the application
- Security considerations
- Future improvements you'd make

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why Streamlit instead of React?**
A: Streamlit allowed rapid prototyping and is perfect for data-heavy dashboards. 
For production, I could rebuild the frontend in React if needed.

**Q: How do you handle OpenAI API costs?**
A: Implemented caching for repeated queries, use appropriate models (GPT-3.5 for 
simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex), and set token limits.

**Q: What about security?**
A: API keys stored as environment variables, Pydantic validation on all inputs, 
SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection, CORS properly configured.

**Q: How would you scale this?**
A: Add Redis caching, implement load balancing, use CDN for static assets, 
optimize database queries with indexes, move to managed Kubernetes for orchestration.
